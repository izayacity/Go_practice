package stack

/*
3.3 Stack of Plates: Imagine a (literal) stack of plates. If the stack gets
too high, it might topple. Therefore, in real life, we would likely start a
new stack when the previous stack exceeds some threshold. Implement a data
structure SetOfStacks that mimics this. SetOfStacks should be SetOfStacks.push ()
and SetOfStacks.pop () should behave identically to a single stack (that is,
pop () should return the same values as it would if there were just a signle stack).
FOLLOW UP
Implement a function popAt (int index) which performs a pop operation on a specific sub-stack.
